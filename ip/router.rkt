   This module provides a router.
   A router is a special kind of 
   node that accepts pure IP packets.

   It has connections through ports
   with other nodes. And will forward
   packets to their correct destination.

   In this implementation we implement the link state routing protocol.
   In the link state protocol, each router periodically broadcasts its neighbouring routers (each router has its own ip address). These packets contribute to the construction of a graph. Then each router indepentely calculates a path to all the other nodes. (ie. with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm)

   Currently, the neighbours of a router are determined statically, however we plan to make it dynamic.
